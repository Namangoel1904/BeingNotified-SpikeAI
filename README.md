This project implements a production-ready multi-agent backend aligned with Spike AI’s
Marketing AGI philosophy.

## 🚀 How to Run (Evaluator Instructions)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo>

2. (Optional) Add GA4 Credentials

For GA4 analytics evaluation, place a valid credentials.json
in the project root.

If credentials are not provided, the system will still start and
respond gracefully to analytics queries.
